# OWL Gradebook Scraper

This script scrapes gradebooks on the OWL site. The script only scrapes courses that are located in the favorites bar. 

Individual grades for courses are calculated as well as the GPA (out of 100%) of all scraped courses.

If using this script alone, chromedriver needs to be installed and added to PATH (on PC). Chromedriver.exe needs to be placed in a folder named "assets" in the same location as "main.py"

Otherwise, the executable file can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dWYsOodsIPiDXk3zRwSLUvVnGOqSO4Eq/view?usp=sharing).
